The comparison of the optimal model parameter distributions of the SWAT model showed that the watershed characteristics could be uniquely defined and represented by a hydrologic model due to the differences in the soils.

During the summer, E/ET ratios are highest in wetlands for three watersheds (10% higher than unsaturated soil storage), while lowest for the fourth watershed (20% lower than unsaturated soil storage). Uncertainty of the ET partition parameters is strongly influenced by storage volumes, with large storage volumes increasing partition uncertainty. In addition, higher simulated soil moisture increases estimated E/ET. Although unsaturated soil storage accounts for larger surface areas in these watersheds than wetlands, riverine isotopic composition is more strongly affected by E from wetlands.

In most cases, observed river discharges are used as the boundary condition for lake/reservoir modeling, which limits analyses of different situations and of areas that are ungauged or water bodies with little data available. Therefore, coupling hydrological models with hydrodynamic models seems to be a promising approach to allow one to understand how catchment features (e.g., land use, topography) and river discharges impact the dynamic patterns, including local circulation patterns, water levels and water quality in large water bodies in response to basin-wide forcing factors. In this study, we used a complex, spatially explicit, integrated approach to assess the hydrological responses to external forcing factors such as wind and river discharges, in the hydrodynamics of a large shallow subtropical lake. A large-scale integrated system composed of several sub-watersheds and a lake was analyzed by coupling a large-scale hydrological model with a hydrodynamic model. Our findings indicated that (i) the integrated model improved the capacity for representing the spatial and temporal variability of lake water-surface levels; (ii) the main hydrodynamic processes (water levels and flow structure) are controlled on a seasonal scale (months) by the river discharges, and on a short time scale (days) by wind influence (intensity and direction); and (iii) the modeling strategy allowed evaluation of anthropogenic stressors such as irrigation withdrawals on lake levels. This approach is an attempt to develop a physically based management model to simulate complex systems as a whole, allowing one to understand the main factors controlling the hydrodynamic processes and water levels, and accounting for internal (e.g., recirculation, horizontal mixing) and external factors (e.g., anthropogenic stressors, irrigation).", "PD": "2018-09-01", "TI": "Coupling large-scale hydrological and hydrodynamic modeling: Toward a better comprehension of watershed-shallow lake processes", "DI": "10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.07.045", "DE": ["Hydrologic processes", "Hydrodynamic processes", "Satellite altimetry", "Lake Mirim", "MBG-IPH", "IPH-ECO"]}, {"SO": "HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES", "AF": ["Welch, Chani", "Smith, Aaron A.", "Stadnyk, Tricia A."], "ID": ["LAKE", "STREAMFLOW", "TIME", "WETLANDS", "BALANCE", "MODEL", "CONNECTIVITY", "VARIABILITY", "FRAMEWORK", "ONTARIO"], "LA": "English", "UT": "WOS:000422753200001", "TY": "Journal", "DT": "Journal Article", "AU": ["Welch, C", "Smith, AA", "Stadnyk, TA"], "PY": 2018, "AB": "Highly seasonal boreal catchments are hydrologically complex and generally data poor and, hence, are ripe for investigation using tracer-aided hydrologic models.

Physiographic characteristics were obtained through raster analysis of freely available land cover images, stream networks, and digital elevation models. Correlation analysis indicated that as the percentage coverage of open water increased, so too did the evaporative effects observed at the catchment outlet. Correlation to wetland metrics indicated that increasing the percentage coverage of wetlands can reduce or increase evaporative effects observed, depending on the isotopic metric used and the corresponding drainage density, catchment slope, and presence of headwater lakes. The slopes of river evaporative-mixing lines appear to reflect multifaceted relationships, strongest between catchment slope, headwater lakes, and connected wetlands, whereas mean line-conditioned excess is more directly linked to physiographic variables. Hence, the slopes of river evaporative-mixing lines and mean line-conditioned excess are not interchangeable metrics of evaporative enrichment in a catchment.

Most current watershed models do not effectively incorporate legacy nutrient dynamics, while models that consider legacy effect often have high uncertainty in their treatment of legacy nutrient dynamics. In many intensively managed watersheds, legacy nutrients are a dominant and long-term (> 10 years) source of nutrients to receiving waters, as well as a potentially important nutrient source for crop production. Many existing beneficial management measures have limitations for reducing legacy nutrient losses to surface waters due to appreciable differences in legacy nutrient forms, watershed storage locations, and temporal dynamics compared to those of contemporary nutrient inputs. Recognizing the importance of legacy nutrients is necessary for developing sustainable watershed nutrient management plans for future food, bioenergy, and water security. These plans require strategies to maximize use of legacy nutrient resources to minimize their loss to the atmosphere (e.g., N2O emissions) and surface waters.

This stress demands improved understanding of critical controls on water resource availability, particularly in water-limited regions. Mechanistic predictions of future water resource availability are needed because non-stationary conditions exist in the form of changing climatic conditions, land management paradigms, and ecological disturbance regimes. While historically ecological disturbances have been small and could be neglected relative to climatic effects, evidence is accumulating that ecological disturbances, particularly wildfire, can increase regional water availability. However, wildfire hydrologic impacts are typically estimated locally and at small spatial scales, via disparate measurement methods and analysis techniques, and outside the context of climate change projections. Consequently, the relative importance of climate change driven versus wildfire driven impacts on streamflow remains unknown across the western USA. Here we show that considering wildfire in modeling streamflow significantly improves model predictions. Mixed effects modeling attributed 2%-14% of long-term annual streamflow to wildfire effects. The importance of this wildfire-linked streamflow relative to predicted climate change-induced streamflow reductions ranged from 20%-370% of the streamflow decrease predicted to occur by 2050. The rate of post-wildfire vegetation recovery and the proportion of watershed area burned controlled the wildfire effect.

The reduced complexity model links spatially distributed estimates of annual soil erosion, high-resolution topography, and observed sediment loading to determine the distribution of sediment delivery ratio across a watershed. The model uses two simple two-parameter topographic transfer functions based on the distance and change in elevation from upland sources to the nearest stream channel and then down the stream network. The approach does not attempt to find a single best-calibrated solution of sediment delivery, but uses a model conditioning approach to develop a large number of possible solutions. For each model run, locations that contribute to 90% of the sediment loading are identified and those locations that appear in this set in most of the 10,000 model runs are identified as the sources that are most likely to contribute to most of the sediment delivered to the watershed outlet. Because the underlying model is quite simple and strongly anchored by reliable information on soil erosion, topography, and sediment load, we believe that the ensemble of simulation outputs provides a useful basis for identifying the dominant sediment sources in the watershed.

A top-down synthesis of C-Q patterns was conducted for suspended sediment (SS), total phosphorus (TP), and total nitrogen (TN) for nine major tributaries (15 monitoring sites) to Chesapeake Bay, which represent diverse characteristics in terms of land use, physiography, and hydrological settings. Model coefficients from the recently-developed Weighted Regressions on Time, Discharge, and Season (WRTDS) method were used to make informative interpretation of C-Q relationships. Unlike many previous C-Q studies that focused on stormflow conditions, this approach allows simultaneous examination of various discharge conditions within an uncertainty framework. This synthesis on WRTDS coefficients (i.e., the sensitivity of concentration to discharge) has offered new insights on the complexity of watershed function. Results show that watershed export has been dominated by mobilization patterns for SS and TP (particulate-dominated species) and chemostasis patterns for TN (dissolved-dominated species) under many river discharge conditions. Among nine possible modalities of low-flow vs. high-flow patterns, the three most frequent modalities are mobilization vs. mobilization (17 cases), chemostasis vs. mobilization (13 cases), and chemostasis vs. chemostasis (7 cases), representing 82% of all 45 watershed-constituent pairs. The general lack of dilution patterns may suggest that none of these constituents has been supply-limited in these watersheds. For many watershed-constituent combinations, results show clear temporal non-stationarity in C-Q relationships under selected time-invariant discharges, reflecting major changes in dominant watershed sources due to anthropogenic actions. These results highlight the potential pitfalls of assuming fixed C-Q relationships in the record. Overall, this work demonstrates the utility of WRTDS model coefficients for interpretation of river water-quality data and for generation of sensible hypotheses on dominant processes in different watersheds. The approach is readily adaptable to other river systems, where long-term discretely-sampled data are available, to decipher complex interactions between hydrological and biogeochemical processes.

Anticipated climate changes and an expanding populace are expected to further impede the efficient use of water. In this study, hydrological modeling was applied to Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) modeling in the Ganga catchment, over a region of 15 621.612 km(2) in the southern part of Uttar Pradesh. The primary goals of this study are: (1) To test the execution and applicability of the SWAT model in anticipating runoff and sediment yield; and (2) to compare and determine the best calibration algorithm among three popular algorithms-sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 (SUFI-2), the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE), and parallel solution (ParaSol). The input data used in the SWAT were the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model (DEM), Landsat-8 satellite imagery, soil data, and daily meteorological data. The watershed of the study area was delineated into 46 sub-watersheds, and a land use/land cover (LULC) map and soil map were used to create hydrological response units (HRUs). Models utilizing SUFI-2, GLUE, and ParaSol methods were constructed, and these algorithms were compared based on five categories: their objective functions, the concepts used, their performances, the values of P-factors, and the values of R-factors. As a result, it was observed that SUFI-2 is a better performer than the other two algorithms for use in calibrating Indian watersheds, as this method requires fewer runs for a computational model and yields the best results among the three algorithms. ParaSol is the worst performer among the three algorithms. After calibrating using SUFI-2, five parameters including the effective channel hydraulic conductivity (CH_K2), the universal soil-loss equation (USLE) support parameter (USLE_P), Manning's n value for the main channel (CH_N2), the surface runoff lag time (SURLAG), and the available water capacity of the soil layer (SOL_AWC) were observed to be the most sensitive parameters for modeling the present watershed. It was also found that the maximum runoff occurred in sub-watershed number 40 (SW#40), while the maximum sediment yield was 50 t.a(-1) for SW#36, which comprised barren land. The average evapotranspiration for the basin was 411.55 mm.a(-1). The calibrated model can be utilized in future to facilitate investigation of the impacts of LULC, climate change, and soil erosion.

In this study, a powerful method, referred to as the Bayesian inference combined with analysis of variance (BayeANOVA) was adopted to detect the timing and magnitude of multiple uncertainty sources and their relative contributions to total uncertainty in simulating daily loadings of three stream water N species (ammonium-N: NH4+-N, nitrate-N: NO3--N and total N: TN) in a rice agricultural watershed (the Tuojia watershed) as influenced by non-point source N pollution. Five sources of uncertainty have been analyzed in this study, which arise from model structure, parameters, inputs, interaction effects between parameters and inputs, and internal variability (induced by random errors of model or environment). The results show that uncertainty in parameters relating to the process f both N and hydrologic cycles contributed the largest fractions of total uncertainty in N loading simulations (58.83%, 63.48% and 61.64% for NH4+-N, NO3--N and TN loading, respectively). Additionally, three of the largest uncertainties (i.e. parameters, inputs and interaction effects) in all three simulated N loadings were on average significantly greater in the rice-growing season relative to the fallow season, primarily due to the excess fertilization application during the rice-growing season. The predicted TN uncertainty was mainly attributed to the inaccuracy of NO3--N simulation, which contributed to 75.48% of predicted TN uncertainty. It is concluded that reducing the parameter uncertainty of NO3--N loading simulation during the rice-growing season is the key factor to improving stream water N modeling precision in rice agricultural watersheds.

This study uses tritium (H-3) activities of stream water to estimate the mean transit times of water in the upper Latrobe and Yarra catchments, southeast Australia, at different flow conditions. The H-3 activities of the stream water were between 1.26 and 1.99 TU, which are lower than those of local rainfall (2.6 to 3.0 TU). H-3 activities in individual subcatchments are almost invariably lowest at low streamflows. Mean transit times calculated from the H-3 activities using a range of lumped parameter models are between 7 and 62 years and are longest during low streamflows. Uncertainties in the estimated mean transit times result from uncertainties in the geometry of the flow systems, uncertainties in the H-3 input, and macroscopic mixing. In addition, simulation of H-3 activities in FEFLOW indicates that heterogeneous hydraulic conductivities increase the range of mean transit times corresponding to a specific H-3 activity. The absolute uncertainties in the mean transit times may be up to +/- 30 years. However, differences between mean transit times at different streamflows in the same catchment or between different sub catchments in the same area are more reliably estimated. Despite the uncertainties, the conclusions that the mean transit times are years to decades and decrease with increasing streamflow are robust. The seasonal variation in major ion geochemistry and H-3 activities indicate that the higher general streamflows in winter are sustained by water displaced from shallower younger stores (e.g., soils or regolith). Poor correlations between H-3 activities and catchment area, drainage density, mean slope, distance to stream, and landuse, imply that mean transit times are controlled by a variety of factors including the hydraulic properties of the soils and aquifers that are difficult to characterise spatially. The long mean transit times imply that there are long-lived stores of water in these catchments that may sustain streamflow over drought periods. Additionally, there may be considerable delay in contaminants reaching the stream. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Although physically-based watershed models have been widely used to estimate nutrient emissions, connections between nutrient abatement and compliance of water quality standards have been rarely considered in NPS hotspot ranking, which may lead to ineffective decision-making. It's critical to develop a strategy to identify priority management areas (PMAs) based on water quality response to nutrient load mitigation. A water quality constrained PMA identification framework was thereby proposed in this study, based on the simulation-optimization approach with ideal load reduction (ILR-SO). It integrates the physically-based Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model and an optimization model under constraints of site-specific water quality standards. To our knowledge, it was the first effort to identify PMAs with simulation-based optimization. The SWAT model was established to simulate temporal and spatial nutrient loading and evaluate effectiveness of pollution mitigation. A metamodel was trained to establish a quantitative relationship between sources and water quality. Ranking of priority areas is based on required nutrient load reduction in each sub-watershed targeting to satisfy water quality standards in waterbodies, which was calculated with genetic algorithm (GA). The proposed approach was used for identification of PMAs on the basis of diffuse total phosphorus (TP) in Lake Dianchi Watershed, one of the three most eutrophic large lakes in China. The modeling results demonstrated that 85% of diffuse TP came from 30% of the watershed area. Compared with the two conventional targeting strategies based on overland nutrient loss and instream nutrient loading, the ILR-SO model identified distinct PMAs and narrowed down the coverage of management areas.

The analysis is undertaken in the context of using streamflow forecasts for environmental flow water management of an open channel drainage network in southern Australia. Forecasts of monthly streamflow are obtained using a conceptual rainfall-runoff model combined with a post-processor error model for uncertainty analysis. This model set-up is applied to two catchments, one with stronger evidence of non-stationarity than the other. A range of metrics are used to assess different aspects of predictive performance, including reliability, sharpness, bias and accuracy. The results indicate that, for most scenarios and metrics, state updating improves predictive performance for both observed rainfall and forecast rainfall sources. Using the shorter calibration period also improves predictive performance, particularly for the catchment with stronger evidence of non-stationarity. The results highlight that a traditional approach of using a long calibration period can degrade predictive performance when there is evidence of non-stationarity.

This study was conducted to assess the ability of the uncalibrated Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to predict annual maximum pesticide concentrations in the flowing water bodies of highly vulnerable small- to medium-sized watersheds. The SWAT was applied to 27 watersheds, largely within the midwest corn belt of the United States, ranging from 20 to 386km(2), and evaluated using consistent input data sets and an uncalibrated parameterization approach. The watersheds were selected from the Atrazine Ecological Exposure Monitoring Program and the Heidelberg Tributary Loading Program, both of which contain high temporal resolution atrazine sampling data from watersheds with exceptionally high vulnerability to atrazine exposure. The model performance was assessed based upon predictions of annual maximum atrazine concentrations in 1-d and 60-d durations, predictions critical in pesticide-threatened and endangered species risk assessments when evaluating potential acute and chronic exposure to aquatic organisms. The simulation results showed that for nearly half of the watersheds simulated, the uncalibrated SWAT model was able to predict annual maximum pesticide concentrations within a narrow range of uncertainty resulting from atrazine application timing patterns. An uncalibrated model's predictive performance is essential for the assessment of pesticide exposure in flowing water bodies, the majority of which have insufficient monitoring data for direct calibration, even in data-rich countries.

Therefore, the main purpose of this work is to assess tangible future flood damage in the urban watershed of the To Lich River in Hanoi, Vietnam. An approach based on spatial analysis, which requires the integration of several types of data related to flood characteristics that include depth, in particular, land-use classes, property values, and damage rates, is applied for the analysis. To simulate the future scenarios of flooding, the effects of climate change and land-use changes are estimated for 2030. Additionally, two scenarios based on the implementation of flood control measures are analyzed to demonstrate the effect of adaptation strategies. The findings show that climate change combined with the expansion of built-up areas increases the vulnerability of urban areas to flooding and economic damage. The results also reveal that the impacts of climate change will increase the total damage from floods by 26%. However, appropriate flood mitigation will be helpful in reducing the impacts of losses from floods by approximately 8% with the restoration of lakes and by approximately 29% with the implementation of water-sensitive urban design (WSUD). This study will be useful in helping to identify and map flood-prone areas at local and regional scales, which can lead to the detection and prioritization of exposed areas for appropriate countermeasures in a timely manner.

The framework was advantageous in reflecting the conflicting equity and benefit objectives for water allocation, maintaining the water balance of watershed, and dealing with system uncertainties. GBSO was solved by the non-dominated sorting Genetic Algorithms-II (NSGA-II), after the parameter uncertainties of the hydrological model have been quantified into the probability distribution of runoff as the inputs of CCP model, and the chance constraints were converted to the corresponding deterministic versions. The proposed model was applied to identify the Pareto optimal water allocation schemes in the Lake Dianchi watershed, China. The optimal Pareto-front results reflected the tradeoff between system benefit (alpha(SB)) and Gini coefficient (alpha(G)) under different significance levels (i.e. q) and different drought scenarios, which reveals the conflicting nature of equity and efficiency in water allocation problems. A lower q generally implies a lower risk of violating the system constraints and a worse drought intensity scenario corresponds to less available water resources, both of which would lead to a decreased system benefit and a less equitable water allocation scheme.

This new ability to match the chemograph with the hydrograph has promoted renewed interest in the concentration-discharge (c-q) relationship and its value in characterizing catchment storage, time lags and legacy effects for both weathering products and anthropogenic pollutants. In this paper we evaluated the stream c-q relationships for a number of water quality determinands (phosphorus, suspended sediments, nitrogen) in intensively managed agricultural catchments based on both high frequency (sub-hourly) and long-term low-frequency (fortnightly-monthly) routine monitoring data. We used resampled high-frequency data to test the uncertainty in water quality parameters (e.g. mean, 95th percentile and load) derived from low-frequency sub-datasets. We showed that the uncertainty in water quality parameters increases with reduced sampling frequency as a function of the c-q slope. We also showed that different sources and delivery pathways control c-q relationship for different solutes and particulates. Secondly, we evaluated the variation in c-q slopes derived from the long-term low frequency data for different determinands and catchments and showed strong chemostatic behaviour for phosphorus and nitrogen due to saturation and agricultural legacy effects. The c-q slope analysis can provide an effective tool to evaluate the current monitoring networks and the effectiveness of water management interventions. This research highlights how improved understanding of solute and particulate dynamics obtained with optical sensors and analysers can be used to understand patterns in long-term water quality time series, reduce the uncertainty in the monitoring data and to manage eutrophication in agricultural catchments.

The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model is widely applied to investigate water quality and water management issues in alpine catchments. However, the model calibration is generally based on discharge records only, and most of the previous studies have defined a unique set of snow parameters for an entire basin. Only a few studies have considered snow observations to validate model results or have taken into account the possible variability of snow parameters for different subbasins. This work presents and compares three possible calibration approaches. The first two procedures are single-objective calibration procedures, for which all parameters of the SWAT model were calibrated according to river discharge alone. Procedures I and II differ from each other by the assumption used to define snow parameters: The first approach assigned a unique set of snow parameters to the entire basin, whereas the second approach assigned different subbasin-specific sets of snow parameters to each subbasin. The third procedure is a multi-objective calibration, in which we considered snow water equivalent (SWE) information at two different spatial scales (i.e. subbasin and elevation band), in addition to discharge measurements. We tested these approaches in the Upper Adige river basin where a dense network of snow depth measurement stations is available. Only the set of parameters obtained with this multi-objective procedure provided an acceptable prediction of both river discharge and SWE.

Sediment fingerprinting is a technique to apportion sources to a downstream sediment sample which, when applied at high spatial and temporal resolutions, can offer insights into catchment sediment dynamics. However, developing an over-arching tool can be hindered due to indeterminate interactions such as, for example, landuse, soil and geological conditions and multiple sediment source pressures. To address this, a multi-proxy sediment fingerprinting approach was used in three catchment observatories in Ireland, characterised and referred to by their predominant soil drainage and land use characteristics: poorly drained grassland, well-drained arable and moderately-drained arable. Potential sediment source groups: channels, field topsoils, and roads, were sampled. Target sediment samples were collected from six sites within each catchment over approximately two-years from May 2012 to May 2014. Geochemical, mineral magnetic and radionuclide tracers were measured in source and target sediment samples and, following justified tracer selection, source proportions were estimated using an uncertainty inclusive un-mixing model. Overall, the poorly-, well-and moderately-drained catchments exported 828, 421 and 619 tonnes, respectively (36, 19 and 33 t km(-2) yfl).

In catchments with high hydrological surface connectivity (moderate and poor soil drainage), exposed soils were most sensitive to soil erosion and sediment delivery. Where groundcover is maintained on these soils, sediment connectivity was diminished and flow energy is transferred to the stream network where channel bank erosion increased. In the well-drained arable catchment, sub-surface flow pathways dominated and consequently channel sources, broadly representative of subsoil characteristics, were the largest sediment source. Sediment connectivity contrasted in the studied agricultural catchments according to source availability, and erosion, transport and delivery processes.

To accurately predict such events, accurate and representative precipitation data are required. Estimating catchment precipitation is, however, difficult due to its high spatial, and, in the mountains, elevation dependent variability. These inaccuracies, together with runoff model limitations, translate into uncertainty in runoff estimates. Thus, in this study, we investigate the value of three precipitation datasets, commonly used in hydrological studies, i.e., station network precipitation (SNP), interpolated grid precipitation (IGP) and radar-based precipitation (RBP), for flood predictions in an alpine catchment. To quantify their effects on runoff simulations, we perform a Bayesian uncertainty analysis with an improved description of model systematic errors. By using periods of different lengths for model calibration, we explore the information content of these three datasets for runoff predictions. Our results from an alpine catchment showed that using SNP resulted in the largest predictive uncertainty and the lowest model performance evaluated by the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency. This performance improved from 0.674 to 0.774 with IGP, and to 0.829 with RBP. The latter two datasets were also much more informative than SNP, as half as many calibration data points were required to obtain a good model performance. Thus, our results show that the various types of precipitation data differ in their value for flood predictions in an alpine catchment and indicate RBP as the most useful dataset.

This study assesses the uncertainty in potential impacts of climate change on the hydro-climate of a headwater sub-catchment of New Zealand's largest catchment (the Clutha River) using a fully distributed hydrological model (WaSiM) and unique ensemble encompassing different uncertainty sources: general circulation model (GCM), emission scenario, bias correction and snow model. The inclusion of snow models is particularly important, given that (1) they are a rarely considered aspect of uncertainty in hydrological modelling studies, and (2) snow has a considerable influence on seasonal patterns of river flow in alpine catchments such as the Clutha. Projected changes in river flow for the 2050s and 2090s encompass substantial increases in stream flow from May to October, and a decline between December and March. The dominant drivers are changes in the seasonal distribution of precipitation (for the 2090s +29 to +84 % in winter) and substantial decreases in the seasonal snow storage due to temperature increase. A quantitative comparison of uncertainty identified GCM structure as the dominant contributor in the seasonal streamflow signal (44-57 %) followed by emission scenario (16-49 %), bias correction (422 %) and snow model (3-10 %).

Assessing its sustainability is important to determining how the current use of water resources can affect their availability in the future and to safeguard their quantity and quality. In this context, this research was designed to develop a simple approach for the evaluation of agricultural sustainability, based on coupling the assessment of the total water footprint (WF) of catchment-scale crops and in-stream monitoring activities. The study focussed on a Mediterranean agricultural watershed (Celone, southeast Italy). Results for the study period (July 2010 June 2011) show the total WF to be 79.9 Mm(3) y(-1), subdivided into 30.3% green water, 0.5% blue water and 69.2% grey water, thus highlighting the importance of grey water in agricultural water use. The grey WF estimates are highly sensitive both to leaching and runoff fractions and applied water standards, and they are affected by large uncertainty. Tomato is the crop having the highest total crop water use (CWU), which is equal to 2521 mm (286 mm green CWU, 412 mm blue CWU, 1823 mm grey CWU). Legumes relied only on green water (217 mm green CWU). The sustainability assessment of present water consumption, subdivided into the three WF components, indicates sustainable use of green water, fluctuating sustainability of blue water resources, depending on the season and the environmental flow requirement, and unsustainable grey water production and water pollution level for the Celone River.

In the Logan River watershed in Northern Utah we found significant amounts of the river water repeatedly gained and then lost through a 35-km study reach.

Streamflow was dominated by discharge of karst conduit groundwater after spring runoff with increasing, yet still small, fractions of matrix water later in the summer.

In this paper, we assess whether adding a time variant scalar to potential evapotranspiration (PET) can be used in place of time variant parameters. Using the HBV hydrologic model and four different simple but common PET methods (Hamon, Priestly-Taylor, Oudin, and Hargreaves), we simulated 60+ years of daily discharge on four rivers in New York state. Allowing all ten model parameters to vary in time achieved good model fits in terms of daily NSE and long-term water balance. However, allowing single model parameters to vary in time - including a scalar on PET - achieved nearly equivalent model fits across PET methods. Overall, varying a PET scalar in time is likely more physically consistent with known biophysical controls on PET as compared to varying parameters conceptualizing innate watershed properties related to soil properties such as wilting point and field capacity. This work suggests that the seeming need for time variance in innate watershed parameters may be due to overly simple evapotranspiration formulations that do not account for all factors controlling evapotranspiration over long time periods.

The principal challenges in spatially conserving multiple ESs are that they are not independent of each other, and that the interactive relationships between them are in the forms of trade-offs and synergies. The rationality of spatial priority conservation on reconciling multiple ESs will be enhanced if the interactive relationships are recognized at the planning stage. Such a framework is developed by integrating a hydrology model into a systematic conservation model, and it is illustrated with data about multiple hydrological ESs in the Teshio watershed, with the aim of developing a priority conservation ranking map that reconciles competing and compromising interactive relationships among multiple services. The water yield, sediment, and organic nutrient retentions concentrated in eastern and some northern areas with higher precipitation, more forest lands, and steeper slope, but the inorganic nutrient retention concentrated in riverine and southwestern places with agricultural lands. The spatial priority conservation ranking map of an individual ES is closely related to its spatially distributed pattern. The spatial priority conservation areas for sediment and organic nutrient retentions are traded off against those for inorganic nutrient retention. There are obvious differences between the spatial priority conservation ranking maps of individual ESs and those of multiple services together. The spatial priority conservation areas for multiple ESs together simultaneously include southwestern, riverine, eastern, and some northern places of the study watershed, which can balance the conflicts existing between sediment and organic nutrient retentions and inorganic nutrient retention. The systematic priority conservation areas of hydrological ESs provide an effective tool for identifying trade-offs between environmental protection and agricultural economic development.

One common approach to mitigating nonpoint source pollution is the use of best management practices (BMPs). However, it can be challenging to evaluate the effectiveness of implemented BMPs due to polices that limit data sharing. In this study, the uncertainty introduced by data sharing limitations is quantified through the use of a watershed model. Results indicated that BMP implementation improved the overall water quality in the region (up to - 15% pollution reduction) and that increasing the area of BMP implementation resulted in higher pollution reduction. However, the model outputs also indicated that uncertainty caused by data sharing limitations resulted in variabilities ranging from -160% to 140%. This shows the importance of data sharing among agencies to better guide current and future conservation programs.", "PD": "2018-12-15", "TI": "Evaluation of the effectiveness of conservation practices under implementation site uncertainty", "DI": "10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.09.035", "DE": ["Targeting method", "SWAT", "Best management practices", "Random implementation", "Spatial distribution"]}, {"SO": "HYDROLOGY RESEARCH", "AF": ["Wu, Jingwen", "Miao, Chiyuan", "Yang, Tiantian", "Duan, Qingyun", "Zhang, Xiaoming"], "ID": ["LAND-USE CHANGE", "LOESS PLATEAU", "SOIL-EROSION", "YELLOW-RIVER", "SWAT MODEL", "EXTREME PRECIPITATION", "RUNOFF", "IMPACTS", "CATCHMENT", "RAINFALL"], "LA": "English", "UT": "WOS:000429613800011", "TY": "Journal", "DT": "Journal Article", "AU": ["Wu, JW", "Miao, CY", "Yang, TT", "Duan, QY", "Zhang, XM"], "PY": 2018, "AB": "Quantifying the impact of climate change and human activities on hydrological processes is of great importance for regional water-resource management. In this study, trend analysis and analysis of the short-term variations in annual streamflow and sediment load in the Yanhe River Basin (YRB) during the period 1972-2011 were conducted using linear regression and the Pettitt test. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was employed to simulate the hydrological processes. The results show that both annual mean streamflow and annual mean sediment load in the YRB significantly decreased (P < 0.05) during the study period. The relative contributions from climate change and human activities to YRB streamflow decline between 1996 and 2011 were estimated to be 55.8 and 44.2%, respectively. In contrast to the results for streamflow, the dominant cause of YRB sedimentload decline was human activity (which explained 64% of the decrease), rather than climate change. The study also demonstrates that topographical characteristics (watershed subdivision threshold value, digital elevation model spatial resolution) can cause uncertainties in the simulated streamflow and sediment-load. The results presented in this paper will increase understanding of the mechanisms of soil loss and will enable more efficient management of water resources in the YRB.", "PD": "2018-02-01", "TI": "Modeling streamflow and sediment responses to climate change and human activities in the Yanhe River, China", "DI": "10.2166/nh.2017.168", "DE": ["climate change", "human activities", "sediment load", "streamflow", "SWAT", "Yanhe River"]}]
